# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Connected my FCC Directory App to my mlab database.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't figure out why I wasn't connecting to the database. After researching some things I got a friend to give a second pair of eyes and realized that my Axios call wasn't passing the data at all. Quick fix. I also updated the app to pull down data from the db and input the individual profiles into the state of the app. Also decided to stick with Redux rather than Jumpsuit because of the lacking documentation for testing on the latter.
