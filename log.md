# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Connected my FCC Directory App to my mlab database.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't figure out why I wasn't connecting to the database. After researching some things I got a friend to give a second pair of eyes and realized that my Axios call wasn't passing the data at all. Quick fix. I also updated the app to pull down data from the db and input the individual profiles into the state of the app. Also decided to stick with Redux rather than Jumpsuit because of the lacking documentation for testing on the latter.

### Day 2: Jan 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Read up on Github Oauth and Firebase.

**Thoughts:** I was reading about how to implement Github Oauth into my app and found that Firebase has some built in functionality for that. While this is not the direction I had hoped to go in I think it will be better in the long run. I will be looking into Firebase more tomorrow.

### Day 3: Jan 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Get app connected to Firebase.

**Thoughts:** I finally got my app connected to Firebase and connected to an mLab database. Added dummy data to test it out.

### Day 4: Jan 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Angular 2

**Thoughts:** Started using Thinksters written tutorial on Angular 2. Didn't get anything commited to repository but did implement Angular CLI to create the app. That has been really helpful.

**No link today**

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning Angular 2

**Thoughts:** Learned about Routing, Directives, NgModule, Directives, Pipes. Coming from React this has been really interesting. In some ways I feel Angular is complicating things more, but in others it seems better.

### Day 6: Jan 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning Angular 2. Successfully built app that shows data, passess data to child components and filters the data. 

**Thoughts:** Really proud of today's work. It has been harder than anticipated, but it has also been rewarding.

### Day 7: Jan 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Trying to hook up my Angular 2 app with the backend. Couldn't get post request to work.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to subscribe to the observable. Don't remember how to do that off the top of my head. I'm hoping sleep will clear my head.

### Day 8-9: Jan 9-10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've been busy the last couple of days and forgot to post about my progress. I finally finished my Angular app and sent it off to be evaluated. I was able to create a custom Pipe also to filter my data being displayed. All in all it was a lot of fun. 

**Thoughts:** I am still getting the hang of Angular and learning to think in Angular. I am glad I was able to finish it quickly.
