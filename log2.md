# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched and coded along with Stephen Grider's [course on React Native](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course). Finished sections 11 and 12.

**Thoughts:** It's been a few days since I watched some of the course. Digging deeper with redux was a great refresher on exactly how Redux is working. I honestly miss working with React and Redux on a daily basis. Committing to the 100DaysOfCode again seems like the best way to learn things so here it goes again.
