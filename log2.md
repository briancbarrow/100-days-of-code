# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched and coded along with Stephen Grider's [course on React Native](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course). Finished sections 11 and 12.

**Thoughts:** It's been a few days since I watched some of the course. Digging deeper with redux was a great refresher on exactly how Redux is working. I honestly miss working with React and Redux on a daily basis. Committing to the 100DaysOfCode again seems like the best way to learn things so here it goes again.

### Day 2: Jan 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: The plan today was to try to build my own simple app in react native. I kept running into issues with my computer running slow and not running commands. I finally figured out what the culprit was and fixed that. After getting that fixed I then tried to start running the new app in the simulator and kept getting the "could not find bundle" error. I tried a few different solutions that I found on github/stackoverflow but nothing seemed to work. So in short, nothing got done today, but it wasn't for lack of trying.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully I can get something done tomorrow.

### Day 3: Jan 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I was able to figure out how to get things up and running and started on my own simple app. I was able to add all the input fields I wanted. I got hung up trying to figure out how to implement the Picker/dropdown element for React Native. I couldn't get the styling down right. I eventually resorted to using [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-material-dropdown) for their dropdown element.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to dive deeper into how to style things in React Native, or at least how to play around with the styling like you can in Chrome Dev Tools.

### Day 4: Jan 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I didn't get any work done on my app because this evening was the FreeCodeCamp study group. We followed Wes Bos along his JavaScript30 course.

**Thoughts:** It was a lot of fun reviewing functions like `map` and `reduce` and `sort`. Definitely a good refresher. It made me even more excited to get watching courses from FrontEnd Masters.

**Link to work:** no link for this day
